<h1>We learn so much every single day. But do we remember all that we learnt?</h1>

<h2> As of 2020, the typical (online class) student spends 1-2 hours on social media. Since most social media platforms are short form content, the mere 1-2 hours is enough for one to consume massive amounts of content.</h2>
<br>
<h2> Even after such content consumption, one tends to remember a funny joke or informative post that stuck with them in the midst of an avalanche of media. Perhaps we even find ourselves thinking about a friends post long after we've seen it. Why does this happen? </h2>
<br>
<h1> Because it has captured our attention and is in line with our interests. <h1>
<br>
<h1> WeLearnt intends to do the same: <strong>make you engage with your course work with an end product that is not only useful but also improves your understanding of the matter!</strong></h1>
<br>
<h4> How Does It Work? </h4>
<ul>
  <li>After your teacher/lecturer teaches a lesson/class, go to WeLearnt and write one line summary of what you learnt from what was taught. This may be directed by your teacher or you may do it on your own. </li>
  <li> You can have different pages for different subjects.</li>
  <li> Eventually youll have one line summaries of all the lessons taught in class, which will not only help you revise but will also be helpful in terms of understanding concepts, because to summarise a particular topic in a sentence requires thought and consideration and the little effort that you put in everyday will be very helpful for the future. </li>
  <br>
<h3> Since WeLearnt is still in its initial stages of development, here is what you can look forward to: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Being able to "post" your summaries for your fellow classmates or educators to view and learn from.</li>
  <li> No numbers and statistics, making it a platform for mutual learning and sharing and not a hub for social engagement, so you can learn in peace.</li>
  <p> Stay tuned for updates! Web Application coming soon. </p>
